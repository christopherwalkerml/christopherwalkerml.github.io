                        Built solely in python using pygame, RPG was constructed by me <strong>over the course of a month</strong>. Free image sprites were used for the graphics,<br>
                        and the background map was slowly pieced together in photoshop.<br><br>

                        Collision boxes were then added for every single wall, obstacle, enemy, and more.<br><br>

                        <strong>Music and sounds</strong> were also added to liven up the game, as well as health and objectives.<br>
                        There are two quests that the player can complete, as well as 1 hidden item that is obtainable by interacting with an NPC.<br><br>

                        As well as the main map, there are 2 other rooms that the player can enter. The cave, and the house.<br>
                        The house regenerates player health if they are hurt. If the player loses all their health, the game is reset.<br><br>

                        Enemies were also given <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> in the form of states. Attacking, wandering, standing still.<br>
                        All of this was done <strong>without OOP</strong>, and was quite the challenge.

                        Built once again in python using pygame, Scene Generator was a grade 12 assignment intended to make us think outside<br>
                        of the box by using <strong>recursive</strong> algorithms and <strong>Object Oriented Programming</strong>.<br><br>

                        We were told to create a beautiful still image with trees, mountains, or whatever we could come up with using recursion.<br><br>

                        I decided that the assignment would be much more aesthetically pleasing if it were <strong>animated</strong>, so I gave myself the challenge to do just that.<br>
                        Not only that, but I decided that creating a new scene every time the program was run would be a cool feature. I also added day/night cycles to make it feel more realistic.<br><br>

                        <strong>Creativity was a major part of this assignment</strong>, and I feel that I did my best in showing my true creative nature by going <strong>above and beyond</strong> what was asked.<br><br>

                        One of the ideas I used in this application was an improved version of a default notepad app. Usually the notepads are static or snap to a grid, and also take up a lot of a space. <br>
                        What I did is let the user drag their notes wherever they want on the screen, and minimize them to keep more space for other notes.
