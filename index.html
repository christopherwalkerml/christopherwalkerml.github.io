                        <p>
                            I had the pleasure of working at AcuityAds from September 2020 until January 2021 as an Engineering Intern in the backend and product support team.
                            This blog gives a brief overview of my position at this company.

                        <div class="title-text"> About AcuityAds </div>
                        <p>
                            AcuityAds is a leading technology company that provides marketers a one-stop solution for digital advertising.
                            The company brings an integrated ecosystem of privacy-protected data, inventory, brand safety and fraud prevention partners.
                            AcuityAds offers an extensive UI to simplify the client's marketing experience and fulfill all of their needs.
                            While I was working at AcuityAds, their stock price rose by over 700%, and they are developing technology that is at the forefront of the digital marketing field.
                            AcuityAds has several offices around the world, but I worked at their Toronto headquarters as well as remotely for the duration of my internship.

                        <div class="title-text"> Goals </div>
                        <p>
                            I had a couple goals this work term, two main ones, one of which was gaining experience in a team setting, and the other was to gain experience
                            with modern software. I was able to achieve both of these goals and gain more experience than I had originally hoped, getting experience with Docker,
                            Grafana, InfluxDB, MySQL, ELK Stack, Auth0, and most of all Kubernetes and Django.<br>
                            <br>
                            A goal I developed during my term was getting comfortable with MySQL, since I had to use it at my job and had no prior experience due to CIS*2750 being cut short because of COVID-19.
                            I taught myself MySQL outside of work by developing a python bot to manage a private chat forum.<br>
                            <br>
                            I didn't have too many specific goals to the skills or technologies I wanted to work with, as each job and position is different. I was very happy with
                            what I learned.
                        </p>
                        <div class="title-text"> Job Description </div>
                        <p>
                            My job as an Engineering Intern for the first two weeks consisted of converting designing a pattern matching algorithm in python and automating it on schedule.
                            After this, I was tasked with spearheading an internal portal to simplify many internal backend tasks. This was written in Django, being hosted on Kubernetes with a Percona
                            middleware to connect separate pods with the main web server. I was also given frequent tickets to help with smaller scripting tasks here and there, where interacted with
                            several time series databases, and other servers.
                        </p>
                        <div class="title-text"> How does this job relate to your academic studies? </div>
                        <p>
                            Unfortunately there was not much overlap with my academic studies and my job, as the grand majority of my job was Python and Kubernetes.
                            There were a few small things, such as Express (and SQL, had CIS*2750 not been cut short) which did overlap, but they were very small parts of my job.
                            This is almost exactly what I had been expecting since school courses don't often go into detail about specific parts of computer science, but principles as a whole.
                        </p>
                        <div class="title-text"> Conclusion </div>
                        <p>
                            In conclusion, I am very pleased with my experience at AcuityAds and couldnt have wished for a better first co-op.
                        </p>
                        <div class="title-text"> Acknowledgments </div>
                        <p class="final-p">
                            I would like to thank my supervisor and coworkers for making my time at Acuity so enjoyable and beneficial towards my future.

                            I had the pleasure of working at Oracle from May 2021 until August 2021 as a Software Developer Intern as a part of the NetSuite department.

                        <p>
                            Oracle is an American multinational computer technology corporation headquartered in Austin, Texas.
                            Oracle sells database software and technology, cloud engineered systems, and enterprise software products - particularly its own brands of database management systems.
                            In 2020, Oracle was the second-largest software company in the world by revenue and market capitalization.
                            The company also develops and builds tools for database development and systems of middle-tier software, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software,
                            Human Capital Management (HCM) software, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software (AKA customer experience),
                            Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) software, and Supply Chain Management (SCM) software.

                        <div class="title-text"> Goals </div>
                        <p>
                            I had a couple goals this work term, two main ones, one of which was getting better at overall communication, and the other was to gain more experience overall.
                            I was able to achieve both of these goals, as I worked more with Python and multiprocessing, as well as Jet, a React-like framework, the latter of which many modern
                            companies use today.<br>
                            <br>

                        <p>
                            My job as an Engineering Intern for the first month consisted of refactoring old scripts and implemented multiprocessing in important and time-heavy scripts.
                            After this, I was tasked with leading an internal migration for a technology stack that consisted of SpringBoot and raw JS,HTML,CSS to a technology stack that had
                            Jet as the frontend framework. This task consisted of rewriting many JS and HTML files, as well as adding endpoints and promises to enable the frontend and backend to
                            be able to communicate. I also led the development of the new UI for this internal tool.
